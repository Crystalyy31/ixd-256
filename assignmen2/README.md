# Project description:

This is a children education tool that aims to let children have a brief understanding of pregnancy and knowing the process that their mother experienced. Symbol of wave represent fetal movement, other symbol likes eyes and ears would also grow bigger representing a significant development during particular month. Use M5 stack and receive analog input value from the heart pressed by putting a pressure sensor inside. People say that baby is sharing the same heart beat with their mother durning pregnancy, and heart also symbolize life. That's why I sewed a heart input to lead the change of different stages.
